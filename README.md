# Game

This is an implementation of a Minesweeper game. It is meant to be run from an IDE like Eclipse, as the main
method does not work for command line/Unix environments. Upon running of the program, you will be asked how many rows and columns you would like to play with. Once the input is accepted, the game will begin and the board will be randomly populated with mines. The amount of mines is calculated to match the size of the game board.

The user can play by putting in simple commands such as " r 1 2". This would reveal the mine at row 1, column 2. Help on the commands you can use in the game, or how to play the game itself, can always be accessed by typing in "h" or "help"
